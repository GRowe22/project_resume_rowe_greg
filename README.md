## Resources
* [Visually Hidden](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) I used boilerplate code to remove headings that created html structure, but were not visually necessary.
* [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/) This is the jQuery plugin I used to obtain the heading that expands and reduces as the window size changes.
* [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/) This is the jQuery plugin I used to obtain the popup style tooltip when you hover over the image.

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.

## Comments
* I understand that my current resume doesn't currently revolve around designing...but it will one day.  Today, it is what it is.  I also feel like I could have done more with the design...but ran short of time.

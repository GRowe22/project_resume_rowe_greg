                <p>In the early stages of my life, I was always interested in computers and art. What better way to combine the two interests than graphic design. I began the process of teaching myself digital design about 20 years ago. To legitimize myself, I am currently enrolled in a Master's Program in Web Design at the University of Florida...and hope to finish soon.</p>
